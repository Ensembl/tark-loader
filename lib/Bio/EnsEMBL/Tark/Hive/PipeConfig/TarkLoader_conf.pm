=head2 pipeline_analyses
  Description : Implements pipeline_analyses() interface method of
                Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::HiveGeneric_conf that defines the
                structure of the pipeline: analyses, jobs, rules, etc.
                Here it defines three analyses:
                  * 'chunk_sequences' which uses the FastaFactory runnable to split
                     sequences in an input file into smaller chunks
                  * 'count_atgc' which takes a chunk produced by chunk_sequences,
                    and tallies the number of occurrences of each base in the
                    sequence(s) in the file
                  * 'calc_overall_percentage' which takes the base count subtotals
                    from all count_atgc jobs and calculates the overall %GC in the
                    sequence(s) in the original input file. The
                    'calc_overall_percentage' job is blocked by a semaphore until
                    all count_atgc jobs have completed.
